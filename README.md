The Odin Project - Calculator

Create a calculator that has mouse and keyboard support to do simple math
functions including addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Ability to use decimal places, but rounds decimal results to only display 8
digits after the decimal place to prevent issues displaying.

Constraints include not being able to click equals without having a firstNum, 
an operator, and a secondNum already selected. Decimal places are only able to
be entered once in each number string to prevent errors. Divide by zero errors
are also handled with an error message.

Keyboard support includes 0-9 keys, +, -, *, /, =, Enter (=), and Escape (AC).

Added: % functionality
Added: animated glowing border

Current bugs:
- percentage of another number is not working correctly
